          We read books to gain knowledge, expand our understanding of the
          world, improve our vocabulary and writing skills, experience different
          perspectives, be entertained, develop empathy, and stimulate our
          creativity, all while potentially enhancing our analytical thinking
          abilities and memory through engagement with the story and characters.{" "}

          Why reading a book is essential ??

        <p className="mx-4">
          Reading books is considered necessary because it significantly
          improves cognitive abilities like critical thinking, concentration,
          and analytical skills, broadens knowledge by exposing you to diverse
          perspectives, enhances vocabulary, and can even contribute to better
          mental health by reducing stress and fostering empathy.{" "}
